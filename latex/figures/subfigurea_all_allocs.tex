    \caption{Allocation and free performance for single and mixed-size tests. Each allocation/free is handled by a unique thread. The x-axis is the $log_2$ of the allocation size for the single-size tests and the upper range for the mixed-size tests, with the lower range fixed at 16 bytes. The y-axis is median latency per thread across 50 runs. Lower is better.}
