    \caption{Fragmentation performance for both single-sized and mixed-size allocations. 
    % All tests were run with 1,000,000 allocations. 
    The x-axis is the allocation size for the single-sized test and the upper bound of the range for the mixed-size test, with the lower bound being fixed at 16 bytes. The y-axis is the difference between the highest and lowest address given for an allocation. 
    Lower is better.}
