    \caption{Utilization performance - allocators perform allocations of a set size until they cannot provide allocations or timeout.
    % This experiment was run with the allocators configured to 2 GB of memory. 
    The y-axis is a ratio compared to the maximum possible \# of allocations that could be given. Higher is better.}
